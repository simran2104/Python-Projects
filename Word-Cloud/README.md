<h3 align="center">Making a Word Cloud image Containing word's size based on their frequency.</h3>


In this I have created a "Word Cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from the dictionary.

<h1 align="center">Cater Pillar Game</h1>

<p>
This is the game made in Python using its two library "Turtle" and "Random". In this, the user has to make the caterpillar to eat the food given in the GUI and the very moment it eats, the score increases by 10 and the very moment it touches the boundary, the game ends. And with the increase in the food it eats, its speed starts increasing.

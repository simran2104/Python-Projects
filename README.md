  <a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Egg_catcher"><h3>1. Egg Catcher</h3></a>
<p>
This is basically a small game made in Python using "itertools", "random", "tkinter" libraries. In this is game, the user will be provided with a bucket. From the sky, some eggs will be fell and the user has to catch that eggs with the provided bucket. Everytime, the user looses a egg, one live will be decreased. Total 3 lives will be provided. And everytime, it catches a egg, score will be increased by 10.

  <a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Automatic_System_Usage_Detector"><h3>3. Automatic System Usage Detector</h3></a>
  <p>
    Automatically detects whether due to overheating you have to shut down your PC or not. It prints "ERROR!", if your remaining Disk Usage is less than 20% and average CPU Usage in 1 sec is greater than 75%. Otherwise prints "Everything is OK!". It also checks your network connectivity.

  <a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Cater_pillar"><h3>4. Cater Pillar game</h3></a>
  <p>
This is the game made in Python using its two library "Turtle" and "Random". In this, the user has to make the caterpillar to eat the food given in the GUI and the very moment it eats, the score increases by 10 and the very moment it touches the boundary, the game ends. And with the increase in the food it eats, its speed starts increasing.

<a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Dice_stimulator"><h3>5. Dice Stimulator</h3></a>
<p>
This is a type of GUI which is made in Python using "Random" library. It just shows the user the dice image made using alpha-numeric symbols. Everytime the user rolls the dice, the random function randomly choose a no. and the dice image graphics will be shown.

<a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Dictionary"><h3>7. Dictionary</h3></a>
<p>
This is the simple dictionary made in Python using libraries: "json" and "difflib". In this, user is asked with a word of which he wants to know the meaning of. And then using "data.json" file, he will be get to know its meaning.

<a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Hangman"><h3>12. Hangman</h3></a>
<p>
This is a small game made in Python using library "random". In this game user has to guess a word with a alphabets. Everytime, the user is asked for the alphabet, if the alphabet is in the word then it is added to its required position otherwise one live will be lose. Total 9 lives be provided.

<a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Hangman"><h3>13. Slither-The Snake Game</h3></a>
<p>
The game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by turning only left or right by ninety degrees until you manage to eat an apple. When you get the apple, the Snake grows an extra block or body segment.
If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats himself the game is over. The more apples the snake eats the higher the score.</p>

<p>
Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a pencil, and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, that neither player will win.

<a href="https://github.com/simran2104/Python-Projects/tree/main/Word-Cloud"><h3>16. Word Cloud</h3></a>
<p>Making a Word Cloud image Containing word's size based on their frequency.
In this I have created a "Word Cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from the dictionary.
